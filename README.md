# React Portfolio

Refactoring my portfolio site https://benedictakim.github.io/
*from using: materialize css framework and css and js 

*to a portfolio using: React, react materialize, Node

Advantages to refactoring to React:
one code set for each repeating content - change in one place, publish everywhere applicable
-header
-footer
-project carousel


Next steps:
1. reconcile top navbar with list nav bar - react router?
(top nav color, slide nav for mobile)
2. contact form
3. carousel for homepage
4. footer sticky at bottom
5. portolio component
   props: title, image, open application (link to deployed link), review code (link to github repo)
6. svg display of tech: https://www.zivkarmi.com/
