        <h4>Web Content</h4>
        <p>I fell into website content sixteen years ago and keep following the rabbit down the hole - ever more curious. 
        Keeping up with the constantly changing digital landscape is part of the fun and challenge of working in communications. 
        I started out with managing a small website about a little known vaccine-preventable childhood disease, worrying about making the site accessible to policymakers in parts of the world with dial-up connections. 
        Most recently, I led the transition of a legacy enterprise subsite of a big, world-renowned institution to mobile-first.

        <h4> Website Developer</h4>
        <p>I’m currently following the rabbit into the hole of coding and training as a full stack website developer. 
        Expanding my skills sets beyond website content to programming languages further adds to my versatility. 
        I am a jack of all trades and can wear many hats and collaborate and troubleshoot with mult-disciplinary teams.
        </p>
        <h4> Seeking Projects</h4>
        <p>With my content and coding skills sets, I’m looking for data visualization opportunities to create the storytelling synergy of marrying compelling stories with digestible data. 
        I’m passionate about my communications career in global health and mental health as I continue to strive to inform the public and policy makers by connecting the data to the personal stories.
